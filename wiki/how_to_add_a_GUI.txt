// BASIC IDEA \\

1. Create the FXML file using SceneBuilder (as linked by Damian). Make sure it ends up in the default src folder.
2. Install e(fx)clipse in your Eclipse IDE by going to Help > Install New Software > 
	and in the 'Work with:' field select 'Oxygen - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen'
	then filter for e(fx)clipse and install that
3. Create a new GUI java file in the GUI package.
4. For information on how to properly link each GUI element and handler, refer to section 'Linking Elements' below.
5. Create member variables (private, by preference) for each of your GUI fx:id elements.
6. Create handler functions (like in LandingGUI.java) for each of your onAction events.
7. Add an attribute for fx:controller in your <VBox...> top-most attribute which links to GUI.YourGuiJavaFile.
	=> Look in Landing_GUI.fxml for an example of this.
8. Add the stage (as instructed in Start.java).


// LINKING ELEMENTS \\

Elements in the GUI need to be TAGGED.
The fx:id field (which can be set in the inspector's 3rd drop-down option) need to be set for each button, text, etc. that you need access to.
The onAction (starting with #) needs to be set for each button for which you want to have a callback handler.

THE NAMES OF THE MEMBER VARIABLES & EVENT HANDLERS ((MUST)) MATCH THE IDs AND ONACTION NAMES PROVIDED.
Make sure to also have @FXML above the handlers and members.
